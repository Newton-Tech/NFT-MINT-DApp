This is a ReactJS code that implements a minting portal for an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collection. The portal allows users to connect their Ethereum wallets, select the amount of NFTs to mint, and buy them. The portal also displays information about the total number of NFTs minted so far and the list of NFTs owned by different wallets.
